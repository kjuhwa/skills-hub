# Organization Soft-Delete: 30-Day Grace Period

**Fact.** Deleting an organization marks `dtime` but retains data for 30 days (configurable). A scheduled job sweeps anything past the grace window.

**Why.** Tenant deletion is high-blast-radius — undoing a mis-click that wipes thousands of users + licenses + audit trail is impossible without a grace window. 30 days aligns with typical customer-facing "are you sure" dispute window.

**How to apply.** Never design a feature that assumes "organization deleted → gone immediately". Queries against active orgs must filter `dtime` null. Cleanup/GC code must respect the interval — don't hard-delete on the delete API call.
