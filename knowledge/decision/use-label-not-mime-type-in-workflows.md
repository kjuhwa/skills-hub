# Use Label Not Mime Type In Workflows

## Fact

MIME types and verbose descriptions drift across versions and tools (e.g. Markdown moved from text/x-markdown to text/markdown; PE binaries moved MIME). Magika's label values are immutable strings ('python', 'pdf') and are the only reliable field for backwards-compatible pipelines.
