# Numpy Unpinned No Workaround

## Fact

An earlier version pinned numpy to support Python 3.8, but the constraint was redundant — numpy declares python_requires in its metadata and pip discards incompatible versions on its own. The unpin reduces maintenance burden with no functional regression.

## Evidence

- `commit 2e6742c`
- `https://iscinumpy.dev/post/bound-version-constraints/`
