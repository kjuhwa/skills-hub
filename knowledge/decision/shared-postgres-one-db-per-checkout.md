One Docker Compose `postgres` service serves every checkout on the machine. Each worktree gets its own:
- `POSTGRES_DB` name (derived from worktree directory slug)
- `PORT` and `FRONTEND_PORT` (derived from worktree path hash, to avoid collisions)

All checkouts still connect to `localhost:5432`. The main checkout uses `.env` and DB `multica`; worktrees use `.env.worktree` with names like `multica_my_feature_702`.

## Why

The naive alternative — one Compose project per worktree — wastes disk (one volume per worktree), ties up ports, and makes "test main and branch side-by-side" painful. One shared container with per-DB isolation keeps Docker resource usage flat while still isolating schema and data.

Hard rule: worktrees must use `.env.worktree` not `.env`. The Makefile prefers `.env` if it exists, so a stray `.env` in a worktree accidentally points it at the main database — real footgun. Tools that generate worktree envs (`scripts/init-worktree-env.sh`) refuse to overwrite existing ones.

Database creation is automatic: `make setup`, `make start`, `make dev`, `make test`, `make migrate-up/down`, and `make check` all ensure the target DB exists via `scripts/ensure-postgres.sh` before running.

## Evidence

- `CONTRIBUTING.md` "Development Model" and "Environment Files" sections.
- `Makefile:3-10` — ENV_FILE preference logic.
- `scripts/ensure-postgres.sh` (referenced) — idempotent DB-exists check.
