summary: Before a product is live, prefer removing old code paths over preserving old-plus-new behavior — avoid compat layers, dual-write logic, legacy adapters, and temporary shims.

Explicit rule: unless the user asks for backwards compatibility, do not add compatibility layers, fallback paths, dual-write logic, legacy adapters, or temporary shims. If a flow or API is being replaced and the product is not yet live, remove the old path instead of preserving both.

## Why

Shims and fallbacks accumulate; each one adds a branch that must be tested, documented, and eventually removed. Pre-launch, there are no external users to protect, so the cost of "keeping the old one" is paid forever while the benefit is zero. This rule also applies to broad refactors — don't do them unless the task requires it.

Concrete manifestation in the repo: when the auth flow moved from localStorage token to HttpOnly cookie, the old path was removed, not kept as a fallback. When workspace identity moved to URL, the `multica_workspace_id` localStorage key was deleted.

## Evidence

- CLAUDE.md, "Coding Rules" — explicit rule.
- `docs/workspace-url-refactor-proposal.md:88-91` — "唯一的硬中断点：现有的 /issues 等 URL 在重构后会 404" (old routes just 404 after refactor, no redirect).
