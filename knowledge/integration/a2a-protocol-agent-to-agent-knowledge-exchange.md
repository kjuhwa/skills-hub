# A2A — Agent-to-Agent Knowledge Exchange

A2A is Evolver's federation layer. Agents export eligible genes/capsules (after passing broadcast gates), and import remote assets as low-trust candidates.

## Trust hierarchy

1. Locally validated (full confidence)
2. Trusted peer (confidence × ~0.9)
3. Untrusted external (confidence × ~0.6)

External assets start at the bottom of the ladder. They earn promotion by accumulating a success streak on the local node — same mechanism as native candidates.

## Message shapes

- `HELLO` — identity + inventory (counts, schema version).
- `PUBLISH` — one asset with `content_hash`, `schema_version`, `body`.
- `DECISION` — `accept | quarantine | reject` response back to the sender.

## Why it matters

This turns isolated agents into a learning mesh without a central registry. The publish gates + streak elevation keep the mesh noise-resistant: even if a peer is compromised or buggy, its bad assets can't silently pollute others.

## Reuse notes

The protocol doesn't require HTTP — a shared JSONL mailbox or Kafka topic works equally well. Keep the wire format JSON, keep the trust math explicit and env-configurable.
