# Technical Requirement ID Registry
#
# PURPOSE: Persistent, stable IDs for every GDD technical requirement.
# Prevents TR-ID renumbering across /architecture-review runs, which would
# break story references.
#
# RULES:
#   - IDs are PERMANENT. Never renumber, never delete (use status: deprecated).
#   - Add new entries only at the END of each system's list.
#   - When a GDD requirement is reworded (same intent): update `requirement`
#     text and add a `revised` date. The ID stays the same.
#   - When a requirement is removed from the GDD: set status: deprecated.
#   - When a requirement is split or replaced: set status: superseded-by with
#     the new TR-ID(s).
#
# WRITTEN BY: /architecture-review (appends new entries, never overwrites)
# READ BY:    /create-stories (embed IDs in stories)
#             /story-done (look up current requirement text at review time)
#             /story-readiness (validate TR-ID exists and is active)
#
# ID FORMAT: TR-[system-slug]-[NNN]
#   system-slug = short slug matching the GDD system name
#   NNN = three-digit zero-padded sequence per system, starting at 001
#
# STATUS VALUES: active | deprecated | superseded-by: TR-[system]-NNN
