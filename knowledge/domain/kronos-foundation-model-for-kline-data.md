# Kronos: a foundation model for the "language" of financial markets

Kronos (AAAI 2026, arXiv:2508.02739) is the first open-source family of decoder-only foundation models pretrained specifically on financial K-line (candlestick) sequences — `(open, high, low, close, volume, amount)` tuples — gathered from over 45 global exchanges. The project's thesis is that financial data has distinctive non-stationary, high-noise characteristics that generic time-series foundation models do not handle well; a model purpose-built for candles, with a discrete tokenizer and LLM-style autoregressive training, performs better on downstream forecasting and signal-generation tasks.

The project ships:
- A **tokenizer family** (`Kronos-Tokenizer-2k`, `Kronos-Tokenizer-base`) that quantizes each OHLCV step into hierarchical discrete tokens using Binary Spherical Quantization (BSQ).
- A **predictor family** with four sizes: `Kronos-mini` (4.1M, 2048-ctx), `Kronos-small` (24.7M, 512-ctx), `Kronos-base` (102.3M, 512-ctx), and the non-released `Kronos-large` (499.2M).
- A `KronosPredictor` wrapper that handles normalization, AR sampling (temperature, top-k, top-p), per-series denormalization, and single-or-batch prediction.
- Two fine-tuning pipelines: `finetune/` (Qlib-based CN A-share demo with backtest) and `finetune_csv/` (generic CSV with YAML config and DDP support).
- A Flask `webui/` app that loads the model from the Hugging Face Hub and serves interactive candlestick predictions.

Kronos is useful as a reference implementation for anyone building foundation models over multivariate continuous sequences — many of its patterns (BSQ hierarchical tokens, dual-head dependency-aware decoder, rolling-context AR inference) generalize well beyond finance.
