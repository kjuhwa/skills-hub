# Windows Dxgi Memory Leak Mitigation

## Fact
DXGI AcquireNextFrame has a known memory-leak pattern — mitigate via rate-limited acquisition and explicit texture reuse.

## Why it matters
Without the mitigation, long capture sessions OOM on Windows — especially on older GPU drivers.

## Evidence
- Repo: `rustdesk/rustdesk` @ `ac124c0680`
- `libs/scrap/src/dxgi/mod.rs`
