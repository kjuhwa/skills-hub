# Windows Enumerateprinters Api Limitation

## Fact
EnumPrintersW filters by PRINTER_ENUM_LOCAL/CONNECTIONS; doesn't discover remote-only printers.

## Why it matters
Expect some printers to be invisible to the API; document the limitation in user-facing docs.

## Evidence
- Repo: `rustdesk/rustdesk` @ `ac124c0680`
- `src/platform/windows.rs`
