# LoRA target modules: q/v/k/o on LM and DiT, optional proj layers

VoxCPM2's `LoRAConfigV2` exposes three flags that control which parts of the model receive LoRA adapters: `enable_lm` (applies LoRA to the language model's attention layers), `enable_dit` (applies LoRA to the LocDiT diffusion transformer's attention layers), and `enable_proj` (applies LoRA to linear projection layers in both components). The default recommended configuration is `enable_lm=True, enable_dit=True, enable_proj=False`.

The target modules within each component are the standard attention projections: `q_proj`, `k_proj`, `v_proj`, and `o_proj`. This follows the pattern established by LLaMA-style LoRA fine-tuning where targeting all four projections provides better adaptation than targeting only q and v. Enabling `enable_proj=False` keeps the MLP feed-forward layers frozen, which is usually sufficient for voice style adaptation and significantly reduces trainable parameter count.

Setting `enable_proj=True` roughly doubles the number of LoRA parameters and slows training proportionally. It is only necessary for tasks that require deep semantic adaptation (e.g., adapting to a completely new language family not represented in training data).

## Why it matters
Too few LoRA targets (only q/v in LM, not DiT) leaves the diffusion model untuned, which limits voice adaptation. Too many (all projections including MLPs) wastes GPU memory and compute for marginal quality gain in typical fine-tuning scenarios. The `enable_lm=True, enable_dit=True, enable_proj=False` default is a validated starting point.
