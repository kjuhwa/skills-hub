# Prefer safetensors, fall back to .pth

VoxCPM's model loader implements a try-first-then-fallback pattern for AudioVAE checkpoint loading: it first attempts to load `audiovae.safetensors` from the model directory. If that file does not exist, it falls back to `audiovae.pth`. This maintains backward compatibility with older checkpoint releases (which shipped only `.pth` files) while preferring the safer and faster safetensors format for new checkpoints.

The safetensors format is preferred because it cannot execute arbitrary Python code during deserialization (unlike pickle-based `.pth` files), making it safe to load from untrusted sources. It also supports memory-mapped loading, which is faster and has lower peak memory usage for large models.

New checkpoints produced by fine-tuning or training scripts should export AudioVAE weights in safetensors format. The training script (`train_voxcpm_finetune.py`) uses `safetensors.torch.save_file()` for new exports.

## Why it matters
If you distribute a fine-tuned VoxCPM checkpoint and want users to be able to load it with older VoxCPM code that only checks for `.pth`, include both formats. If your checkpoint directory has neither file (e.g., a corrupted download), the fallback chain will raise `FileNotFoundError` with a clear message naming both expected paths. Check both paths exist before distributing.
