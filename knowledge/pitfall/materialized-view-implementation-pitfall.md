# materialized-view-implementation-pitfall

The most frequent pitfall is conflating "stale" with "out-of-date": an MV can be technically stale (last_refresh_at > threshold) yet logically current (no base-table writes occurred since). Simulators that only track wall-clock age produce misleading red alerts and train users to ignore them. Always compute staleness as `max(0, last_base_write_at - last_refresh_at)` rather than `now() - last_refresh_at`, and surface both numbers in the UI so operators understand whether a refresh is actually needed.

A second trap is ignoring refresh-during-write race conditions. Incremental refreshes that read the changelog while new writes arrive can either double-count (if the LSN cursor advances before the merge commits) or miss rows (if writes land between the cursor snapshot and the scan). Simulations that model refresh as an atomic instant miss this entire class of bugs — instead, model refresh as a two-phase operation (snapshot cursor → apply delta → commit cursor) with configurable pause between phases so users can see the race window. Query-planner simulators similarly fail when they assume MV freshness is binary; real planners must reason about bounded-staleness (e.g., "use MV if stale <5min") and your sim should expose that tolerance as a per-query parameter.

Finally, beware refresh-storm cascades: if MV-B depends on MV-A, refreshing A invalidates B, and a naive scheduler triggers both refreshes simultaneously, doubling load exactly when the system is already under pressure. Visualizations that show MVs as independent nodes hide this dependency entirely — always render MV-to-MV edges distinctly from base-to-MV edges, and in simulations, implement a dependency-aware refresh scheduler (topological order with debounce) rather than independent timers per MV.
