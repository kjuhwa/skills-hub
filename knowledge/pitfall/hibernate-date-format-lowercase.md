# Date Format: yyyy vs YYYY

## Fact
In Java `SimpleDateFormat` / `DateTimeFormatter` and in many DB date-format functions, `yyyy` means calendar year while `YYYY` means ISO week-based year. The two differ for dates in the last days of December or first days of January, producing values that are off by one year.

## Why
ISO week-year is defined so every week belongs to exactly one year, which forces the boundary weeks of December/January to borrow from the adjacent year. Most application code wants calendar year.

## How to apply
- Default to lowercase `yyyy` everywhere; only use `YYYY` when you explicitly need ISO week-year.
- Grep existing patterns before adding new ones; one bad format string tends to propagate via copy-paste.
- Add a unit test with a date in late December and early January to catch this in review.
