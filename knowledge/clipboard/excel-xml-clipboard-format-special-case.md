# Excel Xml Clipboard Format Special Case

## Fact
Excel exports as XML Spreadsheet format (not standard MIME); clipboard bridges need a branch to preserve Excel fidelity.

## Why it matters
Losing Excel XML silently downgrades rich paste to plain text.

## Evidence
- Repo: `rustdesk/rustdesk` @ `ac124c0680`
- `src/clipboard.rs`
