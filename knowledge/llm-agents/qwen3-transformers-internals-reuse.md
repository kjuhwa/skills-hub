name: qwen3-transformers-internals-reuse
summary: DFlash reuses Qwen3's attention primitives directly from transformers.models.qwen3.modeling_qwen3 (RMSNorm, RotaryEmbedding, MLP, rotate_half, eager_attention_forward) rather than reimplementing them — trades a transformers version pin for feature parity.

# Reusing Qwen3 internals from transformers

## What DFlash imports

```python
from transformers.models.qwen3.modeling_qwen3 import (
    Qwen3RMSNorm,
    Qwen3RotaryEmbedding,
    Qwen3Config,
    Qwen3PreTrainedModel,
    Qwen3MLP,
    GradientCheckpointingLayer,
    FlashAttentionKwargs,
    rotate_half,
    eager_attention_forward,
    ALL_ATTENTION_FUNCTIONS,
)
```

These are *not* part of the public `transformers` API surface. They live inside the model-specific module and can — and do — change shape between minor `transformers` versions.

## Why this trade-off works here

- Less code to maintain: `Qwen3RMSNorm`, `Qwen3RotaryEmbedding`, and `Qwen3MLP` are drop-in; DFlash only has to implement its attention variant.
- `GradientCheckpointingLayer` gives activation checkpointing for free.
- `ALL_ATTENTION_FUNCTIONS[self.config._attn_implementation]` lets DFlash opt into sdpa / flash-attention-2 / eager without per-backend wiring.

## The version pin

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
transformers = [
    "torch",
    "transformers==4.57.1",    # not ~=, not >=
    "accelerate",
    "typing-extensions",
]
```

Pinning to `==4.57.1` is deliberate: internal APIs (`eager_attention_forward`, `FlashAttentionKwargs`, `ALL_ATTENTION_FUNCTIONS` in particular) have moved or been renamed across HF minor releases. A pin is the cheapest mitigation.

## When to copy this pattern

- **Yes**, if you are building a one-off research fork / draft head for a specific model and you will track HF versions deliberately.
- **No**, if you are shipping a library that must support `transformers>=X`; copy the needed ops into your own module instead of importing from `modeling_qwen3`.

## Signals that a HF upgrade just broke you

- `ImportError: cannot import name 'eager_attention_forward' from ...` → renamed; search HF repo for the new name.
- `TypeError: Qwen3RMSNorm() got unexpected kwarg 'eps'` → signature drift.
- Subtle: silently different RoPE output because internal `rotate_half` swapped half-dims order. Add a smoke test that compares one token's hidden-state hash pre-/post-upgrade.
