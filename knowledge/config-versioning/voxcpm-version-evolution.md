# VoxCPM 0.5B → 1.5 → 2 capability evolution

VoxCPM has gone through three major releases with significant capability and architecture differences between them. VoxCPM 0.5B was the initial release: a 500M parameter model supporting Chinese and English only, with continuation-mode synthesis (no explicit voice design, no controllable cloning). VoxCPM 1.5 expanded to multilingual support and introduced ultimate cloning mode (requires reference transcript). VoxCPM 2 is the current flagship: 2B parameters, approximately 30 language support, 48kHz output via the asymmetric AudioVAE V2, and both voice design mode (parenthesized natural-language control) and controllable cloning.

The versions are **not backward-compatible**. Config schemas differ (`LoRAConfigV1` vs `LoRAConfigV2`), model checkpoint formats differ (safetensors vs .pth availability), and the feature set differs substantially. Code that loads VoxCPM models must detect the architecture from `config.json` and dispatch accordingly rather than assuming a single format.

The `conf/voxcpm_v1.5/` and `conf/voxcpm_v2/` directories in the repository contain version-specific default configurations; do not mix configs across versions.

## Why it matters
When maintaining a codebase that supports multiple VoxCPM checkpoints (e.g., a deployment with both V1.5 for legacy users and V2 for new users), the architecture dispatch pattern is mandatory. Running V2 inference code against a V1.5 checkpoint, or loading V1 LoRA configs for a V2 model, will produce either a crash or silently degraded output.
