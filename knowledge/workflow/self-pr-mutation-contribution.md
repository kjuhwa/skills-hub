# Self-PR — agent contributes back upstream

When a mutation clears a high bar (e.g., score ≥ 0.85 and streak ≥ 3), optionally open a PR back to the public repo the agent is running against.

## PR contents

- Mutation diff (isolated from agent-specific config).
- Canary test results and reproduction steps.
- Motivation: which event(s) prompted the mutation.
- `Signed-off-by` and source-of-origin metadata so maintainers can audit provenance.

Maintainers merge, close, or comment. Feedback feeds back into the agent's strategy.

## Why let the agent push

- Closes the loop: local learnings reach upstream users.
- Provides a clean pressure test — external reviewers catch failures no local gate would.
- Logged as a first-class evolution event so the system tracks its own contribution rate.

## Reuse notes

Gate aggressively: high confidence, high streak, small diff, no secrets. Wrap with a human approval step for anything outside a well-understood area. The feature is high-leverage but high-blast-radius if misconfigured.
