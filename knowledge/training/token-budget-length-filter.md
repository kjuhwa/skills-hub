# Drop samples exceeding max_batch_tokens / batch_size budget

VoxCPM's training data loader filters out samples whose estimated token length exceeds `max_batch_tokens / batch_size` before batching. The token length estimate for a single sample is: `text_len + ceil(audio_duration_seconds * fps / patch_size) + overhead_constant`. This estimate avoids actually encoding the audio (which would require GPU) by approximating the number of audio patches from duration, frame rate, and patch size.

Filtering at the dataset level — dropping samples before they enter the batch — is more efficient than padding to the worst-case maximum length, which would waste computation on padding positions. It also prevents OOM errors that would crash the training run mid-epoch, which is especially costly for multi-GPU training where a single worker OOM kills all processes.

The trade-off is data loss: samples with unusually long audio (>30 seconds, for example) are silently dropped. For training data curated to have audio under 30 seconds, this rarely affects coverage. For fine-tuning on long-form data, increase `max_batch_tokens` accordingly or add a pre-processing step that splits long samples.

## Why it matters
The formula `text_len + ceil(duration * fps / patch_size) + overhead` must be correctly tuned for your AudioVAE's frame rate and patch size. Using VoxCPM2's AudioVAE V2 defaults: fps=50, patch_size=1, overhead=10 gives a reasonable starting estimate. Miscalibrating this formula causes either frequent OOM (underestimate) or excessive data filtering (overestimate).
