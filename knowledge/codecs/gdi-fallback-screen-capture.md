# Gdi Fallback Screen Capture

## Fact
On Windows, try DXGI first; fall back to GDI for legacy/virtual displays that DXGI can't enumerate.

## Why it matters
Virtual displays and RDP sessions often force the GDI path.

## Evidence
- Repo: `rustdesk/rustdesk` @ `ac124c0680`
- `libs/scrap/src/dxgi/mod.rs`
