# Screen Capture Api Evolution Macos

## Fact
macOS capture has shifted: legacy Quartz CGDisplayCreateImage → ScreenCaptureKit (Monterey+) behind a feature flag.

## Why it matters
Plan for dual-code-path during the OS-version transition window; Apple deprecates old APIs aggressively.

## Evidence
- Repo: `rustdesk/rustdesk` @ `ac124c0680`
- `libs/scrap/src/quartz/`
