# Wayland Xwayland Compatibility Quirks

## Fact
Use hbb_common::platform::linux::is_x11_or_headless() to branch between X11 and Wayland paths; headless server needs its own fallback.

## Why it matters
XWayland is not equivalent to native X11 — input and capture behave subtly differently.

## Evidence
- Repo: `rustdesk/rustdesk` @ `ac124c0680`
- `src/platform/linux.rs`
