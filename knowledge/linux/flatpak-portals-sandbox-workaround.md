# Flatpak Portals Sandbox Workaround

## Fact
Flatpak uses XDG desktop portals for screen capture (screencast-portal) instead of direct X11/Wayland.

## Why it matters
Direct X11 capture is blocked in Flatpak; must go through the portal.

## Evidence
- Repo: `rustdesk/rustdesk` @ `ac124c0680`
- `libs/scrap/src/wayland/`
