# Skill file format — YAML frontmatter + markdown

Evolver standardizes skills as markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: <slug>
description: <one-line>
category: <bucket>
kind: skill | knowledge
confidence: high | medium | low
---
```

The body is plain markdown with three conventional sections: **Problem / Mechanism / Reuse**.

## Why this shape

- Human-readable and grep-able.
- Version-controllable (diffs stay tiny).
- Parseable by any tool that reads YAML headers (static site generators, linters, importers).
- Easy to hand-author *and* machine-generate from distillation pipelines.

## Reuse notes

Adopt the *minimum* frontmatter that your tooling needs — name, description, category, confidence. Add source_* fields if the content is imported from another repo so attribution survives as files move. Keep the section headers stable (Problem/Mechanism/Reuse) so downstream tooling can index them.
