# Session Id Window Mapping

## Fact
Desktop: unique session_id per connection; multi-window mapping via params['window_id'].

## Why it matters
Careful — reusing window_id across sessions leads to event crosstalk.

## Evidence
- Repo: `rustdesk/rustdesk` @ `ac124c0680`
- `flutter/lib/desktop/pages/remote_tab_page.dart`
