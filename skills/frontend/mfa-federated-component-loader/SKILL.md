# MFA Federated Component Loader

## Purpose

Implement a robust three-layer dynamic component loading system for Webpack 5 Module Federation. Handles script loading failures gracefully with retry logic, prevents duplicate script injection, and provides type-safe remote consumption.

## When to Use

- Building a micro-frontend architecture with Webpack 5 Module Federation
- Need resilient remote component loading with retry and caching
- Want type-safe consumption of dynamically loaded remote components
- Need to handle network failures when loading remote entries

## Pattern

See `content.md` for full implementation.
