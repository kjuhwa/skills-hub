# Axios Token Refresh Queue

## Purpose

Prevent concurrent token refresh races in SPA applications. When a 401/token-expired response arrives, queue all subsequent failed requests and replay them after a single token refresh completes.

## When to Use

- SPA with JWT access + refresh token flow
- Multiple concurrent API calls that may all receive 401 simultaneously
- Need to avoid N parallel refresh token requests

## Pattern

See `content.md` for full implementation.
