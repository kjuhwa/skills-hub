description: Replace `$unwind`+`$match` on array sub-documents with inline `$filter` so array elements are pruned before any downstream stage — avoids N× document explosion.
category: backend
version: 1.0.0
source_project: lucida-measurement
trigger: MongoDB aggregation uses $unwind immediately followed by $match on the unwound field; pipeline cost grows with outer-doc count × array length.
