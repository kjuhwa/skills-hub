# example/

End-to-end, runnable **example projects** built from (and demonstrating) skills and knowledge in this hub. Unlike `skills/` (snippets) and `knowledge/` (facts), entries here are whole standalone artifacts — tools, dashboards, mini-apps — that someone can clone and run.

## How to use

- Browse the catalog below, pick one, `git clone` or copy its folder.
- Each folder has a self-contained `README.md` with runnable instructions.
- Regenerate this catalog by running `/example_list --refresh` (it re-walks each subfolder's manifest).

## Adding an example

Use the `/example_add <slug>` slash command from a working copy that contains the artifact. It will:

1. Copy the selected files into `example/<slug>/`
2. Generate `README.md` and `manifest.json`
3. Branch, commit, push, and open a PR
4. Update this catalog

Duplication check: `/make_something` invokes `/example_list` first to avoid rebuilding something already here.
