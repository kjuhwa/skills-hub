description: "Quorum performance vs N peers: hypothesis sweet spot is N=3-5; degrades past N=7 due to superlinear coord cost"
category: arch
tags: [quorum, consensus, scaling, hypothesis, performance-curve]
type: hypothesis

premise:
  if: The peer count N in a quorum-based consensus cluster grows
  then: Coordination cost grows superlinearly (each commit needs ⌊N/2⌋+1 acks). Throughput peaks at N=3-5, degrades sharply past N=7. Sweet spot N=5; N=7 only when ≥3 fault tolerance is required.

perspectives:
  - name: Quorum Math Mechanics
    summary: ⌊N/2⌋+1 acks means N=3 → 2 acks, N=5 → 3, N=7 → 4. Each ack is a network round-trip. Tail latency grows with the slowest of ⌊N/2⌋+1 peers.
  - name: Tolerance vs Performance
    summary: N=3 tolerates 1 failure; N=5 tolerates 2; N=7 tolerates 3. Each step adds tolerance but compounds the round-trip count. Most workloads need ≤2 simultaneous failures tolerated.
  - name: Network Topology Effect
    summary: Cross-region peers add round-trip latency that dominates. The same N has very different curves in single-AZ vs multi-region deployments.
  - name: Beyond N=9
    summary: At N≥9 the consensus protocol itself often becomes the bottleneck; alternatives like sharded consensus (Spanner) or hierarchical paxos become more practical.

# Quorum Scaling Curve: Where is the Sweet Spot?

## Introduction

(see frontmatter)

### Background

The hub's `technique/arch/multi-peer-quorum-decision-loop` describes the shape but not the optimal N. Engineering folklore says "3 or 5"; this paper attempts to ground that with a measurable curve.

### Prior art

Etcd, Consul, ZooKeeper deployment guides recommend N=3 or N=5; this paper would compare those recommendations against a benchmark.

## Methods

(planned — see `experiments[0].method` in frontmatter for the full design. This section becomes substantive when `status: implemented` and is checked for length by `_audit_paper_imrad.py` at that point.)

## Results

(pending — experiment status: planned. Run `/hub-paper-experiment-run <slug>` once the experiment completes to populate this section from `experiments[0].result`.)

## Discussion

(see frontmatter)

### Limitations

- "Sweet spot" is workload-dependent; this paper assumes a generic mixed read/write workload
- Network topology (single AZ, multi-AZ, multi-region) drastically shifts the curve; the paper's N=5 sweet-spot claim assumes single-AZ
- Failure tolerance requirements may force higher N regardless of performance

## Provenance

- Authored 2026-04-25, batch of 10
- Body migrated to IMRaD structure 2026-04-25 per `docs/rfc/paper-schema-draft.md` §5 by `_migrate_paper_to_imrad.py`. Pre-IMRaD body is preserved in git history; no semantic claims were rewritten during the migration. For hypothesis-type drafts, Methods + Results sections are stubs until the experiment completes.
