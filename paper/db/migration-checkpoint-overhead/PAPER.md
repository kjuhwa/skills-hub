description: "Per-row checkpoint vs per-batch: hypothesis per-row checkpointing turns crash-safety into the migration's bottleneck"
category: db
tags: [migration, checkpoint, granularity, overhead, hypothesis]
type: hypothesis

premise:
  if: A long-running migration adds checkpoint persistence at progressively finer granularity (per-batch → per-row)
  then: Per-batch checkpoints add <5% overhead. Per-row checkpointing makes the checkpoint table the bottleneck — migration runs 10-50x slower (two writes per row). Recommended granularity — per-batch, not per-row.

perspectives:
  - name: Resume Granularity vs Write Cost
    summary: Per-row checkpoint resumes at any row but costs 2× writes per row. Per-batch resumes at batch boundary at 1 write per batch. Granularity tradeoff is the design choice.
  - name: Crash Probability Determines Optimum
    summary: If crashes are rare (well-tested infra), per-batch is sufficient — at most one batch is re-run on resume. If crashes are frequent, per-row may be justified for very long batches.
  - name: Storage I/O Pattern
    summary: Per-row checkpoint serializes I/O (no batch-write coalescing). Per-batch enables I/O batching, hitting the database's optimal write throughput.
  - name: Lock Contention
    summary: Per-row checkpoint acquires the checkpoint table's lock per row. In high-concurrency environments, this can become its own contention point.

experiments:
  - name: checkpoint-granularity-cost
    hypothesis: Per-row checkpoint is ≥10x slower than per-1000-row at 1M rows. Recovery time roughly equal across granularities (one batch lost worst-case for per-batch, one row for per-row).
    method: Run benchmark at all three granularities; kill mid-run at random points; measure resume + complete time.

# Migration Checkpoint Granularity

## Introduction

(see frontmatter)

### Background

`technique/db/idempotent-migration-with-resume-checkpoint` describes the pattern but does not specify granularity. Practitioners default to either too-fine (per-row) or no-checkpoint. This paper argues for per-batch as the canonical choice.

## Methods

(planned — see `experiments[0].method` in frontmatter for the full design. This section becomes substantive when `status: implemented` and is checked for length by `_audit_paper_imrad.py` at that point.)

## Results

(pending — experiment status: planned. Run `/hub-paper-experiment-run <slug>` once the experiment completes to populate this section from `experiments[0].result`.)

## Discussion

(see frontmatter)

### Limitations

- Database-specific; SQLite, Postgres, MongoDB have different write-amplification characteristics
- Crash-frequency assumption is hard to validate; this paper assumes well-tested production infra
- Does not consider distributed migrations across multiple workers (different checkpointing concerns)

## Provenance

- Authored 2026-04-25, batch of 10
- Body migrated to IMRaD structure 2026-04-25 per `docs/rfc/paper-schema-draft.md` §5 by `_migrate_paper_to_imrad.py`. Pre-IMRaD body is preserved in git history; no semantic claims were rewritten during the migration. For hypothesis-type drafts, Methods + Results sections are stubs until the experiment completes.
