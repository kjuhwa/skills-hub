description: "Canary auto-revert thresholds: hypothesis tight thresholds yield more false reverts than true catches"
category: devops
tags: [canary, auto-revert, kpi-threshold, false-positive, hypothesis]
type: hypothesis

premise:
  if: Auto-revert KPI thresholds in a canary rollout are set too tight (e.g. p99 latency threshold within normal noise)
  then: False-positive reverts (rollback healthy releases) exceed true-positives (catching real regressions). The ratio inverts when threshold is widened to ≥2σ above baseline noise.

perspectives:
  - name: Threshold Tuning is Statistical
    summary: KPI noise has a distribution. Threshold below 2σ catches noise; above 2σ misses small regressions. Single-number thresholds rarely fit the noise envelope.
  - name: True vs False Reverts
    summary: A true revert catches a real regression. A false revert rolls back a healthy build. Both pay the rollout cost; only true reverts pay back. If false:true ratio > 1, auto-revert is net negative.
  - name: Hysteresis as Mitigation
    summary: Adding "trigger if breach for ≥10 minutes" prevents flap but delays detection. The trade-off mirrors circuit-breaker hysteresis.
  - name: Slow-Burn Bugs
    summary: Memory leaks, cache pollution take hours to surface. Canary windows are minutes. Auto-revert never sees them. Threshold calibration is for fast-emerging issues only.

    summary: Tool that ingests baseline KPI metrics, computes noise distribution, recommends threshold settings (μ + Nσ) per KPI with target false-revert rate. Replays historical incidents to validate.

experiments:
  - name: threshold-vs-revert-ratio
    hypothesis: At threshold = baseline + 1σ, false:true revert ratio ≥ 3 (mostly false). At baseline + 2σ, ratio ≈ 1. At baseline + 3σ, ratio ≤ 0.5 (mostly true). Sweet spot is 2-2.5σ.
    method: Replay 50 historical canary deployments (mix of healthy + regressing) at different threshold settings; compute ratios.

# Canary Auto-Revert: Calibrating Thresholds

## Premise

(see frontmatter)

## Background

The `technique/devops/canary-rollout-with-auto-revert` describes the auto-revert shape but specifies thresholds as "configurable" without guidance. This paper proposes the calibration rule.

## Perspectives

(see frontmatter)

## External Context

Datadog, Prometheus, Spinnaker provide KPI monitoring; few document threshold-tuning methodology. Useful research: anomaly detection literature, Tukey fences, EWMA-based thresholds.

## Limitations

- Replay-based validation assumes historical data is representative
- "False positive" definition relies on retrospective verdict; some judgment calls
- Slow-burn issues are explicitly out of scope

## Provenance

- Authored 2026-04-25, batch of 10
